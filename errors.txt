  Forgot to malloc for mod_t structure before starting to use pointer

  When replaying the log on a segment just mapped in, it seeks past log
  entries not pertaining to this segment.  I was accidentally seeking that
  distance plus the size of an offset which is already accounted by the
  replay_log_on_segment() function, so each time I was inadvertently adding an
  addition four bytes to the log file with this seek.
